Over the summer we worked in part with the Race For Wool community to add their public map list to our site. You can check out those maps on our new [RFW page](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/maps/rfw).

Most maps will require a XML file to be created in order to be used with PGM or Atlas. For the couple of maps that do, they are compatible with PGM.
